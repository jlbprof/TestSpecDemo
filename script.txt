Step 001

* Test using Test::Spec
* Testing File::Copy::Recursive

  Not a challenging set of tests, but a simple set of tests.  This allows me
  to explore for you all the aspects of Test::Spec.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 002

* Consolidate the commong code (t/Utils/FileSystemSupport.pm).
* Consolidate all the tests to be used in all the examples.

Step 003

* Here I make some auxillary tests that further explore the syntax
* Note: how the arounds perform, you get the top around, and sub arounds.

Step 004

* Note how a TODO is done
* override the message
* notice what happens when you put 2 assertions in each test

Step 006




XXXXXX

Want to show using before/after and before all/after all

To difficult to test with Test::MockFile, as it does a "chdir";
